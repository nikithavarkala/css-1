    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br/>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media. </li><br/>
        <li><span class="listelt">Css is not necessary</span><span class="elt">CSS saves alot of work.</span><span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</span></li><br/>
        <li class="elt3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS file.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="ulst">
        <li style="color: brown;">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li class="ul1">Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS.is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="elt"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier  to demonstrate. and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference in that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unquie elements,ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS,selection are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selection available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style shoukd be applied.</p>
